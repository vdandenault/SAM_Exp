# SAM_Exp
A quick implementation of Sharpness Awareness Minimization for further use. LINK: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412


SAM achieves better generalization than any other normal optimization method by focusing on seeking parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss value (rather than parameters that only themselves have low loss value)

Since computing neighborhood parameters in addition to computing a single parameter, the loss landscape is flatter comparing to other optimization methods, which in turn increases generalization of the model.
